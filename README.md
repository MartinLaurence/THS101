# LET PROJECT - INSTALLATION AND USAGE GUIDE
======================================================

This document provides detailed instructions for setting up, installing, and running the LET project.

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------------------
- Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher recommended)
- npm (v9.0.0 or higher recommended)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)
- Internet connection (for installing dependencies)

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------------------
This is a React application built with:
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Vite (for fast development and building)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- Firebase (for backend services)
- Chart.js (for data visualization)
- React Router (for navigation)

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------
1. Clone or download the project to your local machine

2. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd path/to/project
   ```

3. Install all required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   This might take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.

## RUNNING THE APPLICATION
------------------------------------------------------
### Development Mode
To run the application in development mode with hot-reload:
```
npm run dev
```
This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.
By default, the application will be available at: http://localhost:5173/

### Building for Production
To create an optimized production build:
```
npm run build
```
This will generate a production-ready build in the 'dist' directory.

### Previewing Production Build
To preview the production build locally:
```
npm run preview
```
This will serve the production build at http://localhost:4173/

## FOLDER STRUCTURE
------------------------------------------------------
- /src - Contains all source code
- /public - Static assets like images and fonts
- /node_modules - Contains all installed packages (generated after npm install)

## ADDITIONAL COMMANDS
------------------------------------------------------
- Run linting: `npm run lint`

## TROUBLESHOOTING
------------------------------------------------------
1. If you encounter any dependency issues, try:
   ```
   npm clean-install
   ```

2. If the application fails to start, check that ports 5173 (dev) or 4173 (preview) 
   are not being used by other applications.

3. For TypeScript errors, ensure you have the correct version of TypeScript installed.

4. Make sure your Node.js version is compatible with the project requirements.
